        "“‘Get busy, nigger’ I was told. ‘This here is one lazy niggeress’” are the first words I ever read by my aunt " +
        "Toni. They are from a book composed of her articles and essays from over her years as a journalist. Even " +
        "though the book was dedicated to me, I could never get past the first page. I don’t exactly know why, and " +
        "I don’t exactly remember the moment I read on from there, but it was shamefully recent. The book was " +
        "published in 1994 right after her death, but for whatever reason I never read past those few words. For " +
        "decades I carried around a copy of One Voice with me constantly. It lived on a bookshelf in whatever dump " +
        "I was occupying at the time and survives to this day not ten feet from where I’m sitting currently. This copy " +
        "is special. It was sent to me from Nancy, my aunt's best friend, when I was a little kid. It may or may not " +
        "have been a sign or an urge from Nancy to read my auntie’s words one day and feel the righteous calling " +
        "of truth that Toni felt. Choosing to dedicate the book to me may or may not have been a message from my " +
        "aunt to do the same. Either way, now I have read the book and it changed everything. Now it's time for me to " +
        "follow a path that I wanted to be on before my eye opening moment. A path I may or may not have been set " +
        "on." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "My Aunt Toni, who is my namesake, was born and raised in Cleveland. When she was younger she displayed " +
        "gifted qualities early on and was sent to study at prestigious private schools and institutions. She attended " +
        "Alexander Hamilton in junior highschool, after that she was accepted into Glen Oak School for Girls, which is " +
        "now Gilmour Academy. Following high school she started off her post-secondary career at Vassar College, " +
        "which was just the beginning. She continued her higher education attending Iowa Writer Workshop’s creative " +
        "writing program followed by attending Columbia Journalism School. Throughout her time in academia she " +
        "spent much time in rooms full of people who did not look like her, and she mentioned this often. I know how I " +
        "felt when I started attending suburban schools with higher numbers of whites. Although in my case, they were " +
        "middle/lower middle class whites, which in my experience are easier to get along with. I, however, could not " +
        "imagine what it was like being a Black woman-a Black child nonetheless in her situation, as she was merely a " +
        "teenager when her journey started. In context to the rest of the strong black women in our family, it is not " +
        "entirely surprising though. They are all exceptionally intelligent, adaptable, fierce and compassionate. For all " +
        "that, she remained diligent, constantly being among the white wealthy class, in white wealthy institutions, all " +
        "while being a “‘down’ sister from Cleveland.” - Donna Britt. Being able to walk through these spaces was a worthy " +
        "endeavor that served her well in her professional career. Because, afterall, where she was headed after that " +
        "wasn’t going to be any less white. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Aunt Toni was an exceptional writer. I only recently found out that she had a passion for fiction writing as well, and " +
        "obviously she was great at it. However, her career was rooted in journalism. I have become so entranced with her " +
        "essays and op-eds the past couple of years. Her interviews and profiles have an elaborate range of prominent " +
        "predominantly black activists, artists, advocates and visionaries. Over the years I have found countless articles " +
        "and images depicting her connections with people such as Toni Morrison, Kwame Ture, Cornel West, James " +
        "Baldwin, Keith Haring, Alice Walker and many other favored social heroes. Funny, I have an original Keith Haring " +
        "that belonged to her. I actually had no idea what it was until a close friend came over, for the first time, and " +
        "shouted “Nigga is this an original Keith Haring!?” I just loved the image, the “Free South Africa,'' message on the " +
        "bottom of it and that it belonged to my Aunt. Her crowning achievement was working at the Dallas Morning " +
        "News “invoking the spirit and power of the black experience,” which won her a Pulitzer Prize. At this point, and " +
        "even before, Auntie had her pick of where she was going with her writing. I am certain that people repeatedly " +
        "ask “what do you/what do you want to write?” I do not have a good answer for that just yet because I really want " +
        "to write about it. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I mentioned before, my aunt shared tables with many prominent voices but she was not just a vessel to " +
        "translate the gospels of civil rights warriors. She also involved herself and lived alongside the experiences she " +
        "was writing about. May 5th, 1990 she published an essay titled My Life as a Slave in which she wrote, “Few things " +
        "make me as mad as the N-word. I never say it, and I challenge other African Americans who do.” while " +
        "experiencing a day in the life of a slave workshop that she asked to join. Something thought-provoking for me, " +
        "because I do use the N-word. An article entitled 500 Americans in Paris toured an artist conference that took " +
        "place in France over a week. The main focus of this article is to highlight the successes of Blacks in Paris, " +
        "speaking of discussions she had with artists and their enthusiasm for Black art, specifically African American. " +
        "Separate from this, I have always wanted to visit and live in France. This article and another made it certain, for " +
        "me, that Paris is where I want to eventually end up. For her admissions letter to Columbia she elegantly " +
        "described the culture shock she experienced at Gilmore. Saying, “I learned something there about the different " +
        "cultures and religions which taught me acceptance rather than tolerance.” Another line that speaks to me and " +
        "my exposure to many different cultures. I could only hope to someday reach her level of acceptance. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "“If you like truth, people, writing, you most certainly need to pursue training in journalism” Which are words " +
        "of hers that I read for the first time four days ago, well after I made the decision to take my writing career more " +
        "seriously. A long time friend of my Aunt Toni sent me books every year and I took advantage of that for so long. " +
        "So long that I never really read the inscriptions she would write. My books are all in storage as I write this, along " +
        "with all the articles that I have that my Aunt wrote. But, I did not store my aunt's book. I never do and I have been " +
        "carrying around my personal copy of it for decades.I recently read the inscription while searching for some kind " +
        "of  message in my Aunt's writing, as I always do. Written by Nancy, the most impactful line, to me is “This book is " +
        "for you, if anyone.” A literal message, that I finally saw. My Aunt saw something in me that she relayed to her " +
        "closest friends and confidants, and I feel that she did leave me clues. Clues and people to connect with in order " +
        "to give me some direction for when I was ready to step into my gift. A gift, that I have been told by so many over " +
        "the years, that I need to find and step into. I am now ready to step into my gift and to see the truth in the world " +
        "and in myself. Toni died when I was about eight years old, and oddly enough, I feel like she knew me better than " +
        "anyone else in my life ever really could. She saw a path for me that no one in my family, except Grandma, could " +
        "even entertain as a possibility. For that, all the clues, and all the resources I have no excuse not to follow, she is " +
        "my guiding light. I, at very least, owe her an honest try at what she saw me accomplishing in my future, and now " +
        "I am trying as hard as I can. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In finding myself through Aunt Toni’s work, I have found so much more acceptance in the person that I am. " +
        "I have seen that the societal thoughts, comparisons, triumphs and failures that I have committed to truths were " +
        "and are, in fact, a piece of her within me. Even before I knew my aunt's thoughts, a fire was lit inside of me from " +
        "the pilot light of her soul. I have remained honest and humble though myself and the tribulations of my life. I do " +
        "not think I’m special but feel that: " +

        "Did you know that having HIV/AIDS can pose legal threats in 37states? During the beginning of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, " +
        "in the 1980s, legislation was passed in an attempt to “curb the spread” of the disease. As we deal with the current " +
        "COVID-19 pandemic, some not only fight legislation that could help stop the spread, but roll back public health protections " +
        "like mask mandates and indoor capacity caps. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Even though the HIV/AIDs pandemic affected all demographics regardless of age, race, and gender, it was designated the ailment " +
        "of homosexuals. This stigma made it easy for the government to prosecute people infected with HIV/AIDS. Criminal statutes–from " +
        "reckless endangerment to attempted murder–can still punish those who simply have potential to expose others to HIV. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The first recorded case of HIV/AIDs in the United States was in 1981. From 1981 to 1983 there were 3,391 recorded cases " +
        "of the illness. With a death rate of nearly 65 percent, HIV/AIDS quickly became some of the most deadly diseases in history. " +
        "From 1981 to 2019 in the U.S. there were 2.2 million HIV infections among people aged 13 and older–and, to date, around " +
        "700,000 deaths." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let’s put that into perspective by comparing HIV/AIDS to COVID-19. In the relatively short TWO years since COVID-19 began, " +
        "there have been 58.9 million confirmed cases. We have lost 833,000 lives. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "COVID-19 has caused more U.S. citizen deaths in the past two years than the all-time, 38-year, number of deaths " +
        "caused by HIV/AIDS. In terms of number of confirmed cases, that’s 58.9 million for COVID-19 since 2019 versus 2.2 million " +
        "for HIV/AIDS since 1981. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "That’s nearly 27 times the infection rate of one of the world’s most notorious illnesses in just two years. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "But instead of trying to mandate our way out of this, many still act as if it should be a personal choice whether to " +
        "protect ourselves and others. Being vaccinated and wearing a mask are the only tools we currently have to reduce future numbers " +
        "of both COVID-19 cases and deaths. Anti-vaxxers and anti-mask conspiracy theorists make this goal nearly impossible for the country. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It doesn’t add up. To this day, you can still be arrested, tried and prosecuted for simply living with HIV/AIDs–yet, " +
