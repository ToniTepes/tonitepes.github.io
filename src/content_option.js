    title: "About me",
    aboutme: "I am excited to share a brief history of my divergent journey with you. I have favored analysis as long as I can remember. The joy of critical thinking, has allowed me to troubleshoot many situational and technical issues I encounter (or create üòä). It has been great exercise for problem solving, seeking efficiency and dreaming up innovative ideas. I have more than a decade of diverse professional experience, including project management at Honda Research and Development, production supervision at Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, and systems and machine maintenance at Umicore Specialty Materials Recycling. This experience, and my post-secondary education, have prepared me well to approach project goals and organizational outcomes from multiple angles. From a young age, the discipline I learned from my parents, both U.S. Marines, and my grandparents, Kentucky farmers, has kept me focused in work and life. My aunt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, taught me the importance of passion, and instilled in me a drive to ask meaningful questions in order to explore new perspectives. Significant research and practice have made me confident in my unique writing style and strong voice. Being a skilled communicator easily connects me with new people, and my passion for photography, music and the arts has connected me with a rich community of artists and makers. This has given me the opportunity to organize beneficial events for local communities. Additionally, computer technology has been a favorite hobby of mine since I was a young child. I have been comfortable with variety of hardware and software applications preceding my Case Western Reserve University education in web development. I feel this diverse life experience, combined with my strong professional skill set, has prepared me well to excel in a compassionate and meaningful way. As science historian James Burke said, ‚Äòinnovation happens in the spaces between formal disciplines.‚Äô Ultimately, I hope to find a position at an organization that shares my values of collaboration and commitment to community growth and support. I ambitiously await the opportunity to learn how I can meet the demands of the ever-changing workforce.",

    tonijoseph: "‚Äú‚ÄòGet busy, nigger‚Äô I was told. ‚ÄòThis here is one lazy niggeress‚Äô‚Äù are the first words I ever read by my aunt Toni. They are from a book composed of her articles and essays from over her years as a journalist. Even though the book was dedicated to me, I could never get past the first page. I don‚Äôt exactly know why, and I don‚Äôt exactly remember the moment I read on from there, but it was shamefully recent. The book was published in 1994 right after her death, but for whatever reason I never read past those few words. For decades I carried around a copy of One Voice with me constantly. It lived on a bookshelf in whatever dump I was occupying at the time and survives to this day not ten feet from where I‚Äôm sitting currently. This copy is special. It was sent to me from Nancy, my aunt's best friend, when I was a little kid. It may or may not have been a sign or an urge from Nancy to read my auntie‚Äôs words one day and feel the righteous calling of truth that Toni felt. Choosing to dedicate the book to me may or may not have been a message from my aunt to do the same. Either way, now I have read the book and it changed everything. Now it's time for me to follow a path that I wanted to be on before my eye opening moment. A path I may or may not have been set on"
