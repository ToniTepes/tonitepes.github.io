    title: "About me",
    aboutme: "I am excited to share a brief history of my divergent journey with you. I have favored analysis as long as I can remember. The joy of critical thinking, has allowed me to troubleshoot many situational and technical issues I encounter (or create ðŸ˜Š). It has been great exercise for problem solving, seeking efficiency and dreaming up innovative ideas. I have more than a decade of diverse professional experience, including project management at Honda Research and Development, production supervision at Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, and systems and machine maintenance at Umicore Specialty Materials Recycling. This experience, and my post-secondary education, have prepared me well to approach project goals and organizational outcomes from multiple angles. From a young age, the discipline I learned from my parents, both U.S. Marines, and my grandparents, Kentucky farmers, has kept me focused in work and life. My aunt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, taught me the importance of passion, and instilled in me a drive to ask meaningful questions in order to explore new perspectives. Significant research and practice have made me confident in my unique writing style and strong voice. Being a skilled communicator easily connects me with new people, and my passion for photography, music and the arts has connected me with a rich community of artists and makers. This has given me the opportunity to organize beneficial events for local communities. Additionally, computer technology has been a favorite hobby of mine since I was a young child. I have been comfortable with variety of hardware and software applications preceding my Case Western Reserve University education in web development. I feel this diverse life experience, combined with my strong professional skill set, has prepared me well to excel in a compassionate and meaningful way. As science historian James Burke said, â€˜innovation happens in the spaces between formal disciplines.â€™ Ultimately, I hope to find a position at an organization that shares my values of collaboration and commitment to community growth and support. I ambitiously await the opportunity to learn how I can meet the demands of the ever-changing workforce.",
