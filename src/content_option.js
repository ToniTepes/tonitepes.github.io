        "“‘Get busy, nigger’ I was told. ‘This here is one lazy niggeress’” are the first words I ever read by my aunt " +
        "Toni. They are from a book composed of her articles and essays from over her years as a journalist. Even " +
        "though the book was dedicated to me, I could never get past the first page. I don’t exactly know why, and " +
        "I don’t exactly remember the moment I read on from there, but it was shamefully recent. The book was " +
        "published in 1994 right after her death, but for whatever reason I never read past those few words. For " +
        "decades I carried around a copy of One Voice with me constantly. It lived on a bookshelf in whatever dump " +
        "I was occupying at the time and survives to this day not ten feet from where I’m sitting currently. This copy " +
        "is special. It was sent to me from Nancy, my aunt's best friend, when I was a little kid. It may or may not " +
        "have been a sign or an urge from Nancy to read my auntie’s words one day and feel the righteous calling " +
        "of truth that Toni felt. Choosing to dedicate the book to me may or may not have been a message from my " +
        "aunt to do the same. Either way, now I have read the book and it changed everything. Now it's time for me to " +

        "My Aunt Toni, who is my namesake, was born and raised in Cleveland. When she was younger she displayed " +
        "gifted qualities early on and was sent to study at prestigious private schools and institutions. She attended " +
        "Alexander Hamilton in junior highschool, after that she was accepted into Glen Oak School for Girls, which is " +
        "now Gilmour Academy. Following high school she started off her post-secondary career at Vassar College, " +
        "which was just the beginning. She continued her higher education attending Iowa Writer Workshop’s creative " +
        "writing program followed by attending Columbia Journalism School. Throughout her time in academia she " +
        "spent much time in rooms full of people who did not look like her, and she mentioned this often. I know how I " +
        "felt when I started attending suburban schools with higher numbers of whites. Although in my case, they were " +
        "middle/lower middle class whites, which in my experience are easier to get along with. I, however, could not " +
        "imagine what it was like being a Black woman-a Black child nonetheless in her situation, as she was merely a " +
        "teenager when her journey started. In context to the rest of the strong Black women in our family, it is not " +
        "entirely surprising though. They are all exceptionally intelligent, adaptable, fierce and compassionate. For all " +
        "that, she remained diligent, constantly being among the white wealthy class, in white wealthy institutions, all " +
        "while being a “‘down’ sister from Cleveland.” - Donna Britt. Being able to walk through these spaces was a worthy " +
        "endeavor that served her well in her professional career. Because, afterall, where she was headed after that " +
        "wasn’t going to be any less white. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Aunt Toni was an exceptional writer. I only recently found out that she had a passion for fiction writing as well, and " +
        "obviously she was great at it. However, her career was rooted in journalism. I have become so entranced with her " +
        "essays and op-eds the past couple of years. Her interviews and profiles have an elaborate range of prominent " +
        "predominantly Black activists, artists, advocates and visionaries. Over the years I have found countless articles " +
        "and images depicting her connections with people such as Toni Morrison, Kwame Ture, Cornel West, James " +
        "Baldwin, Keith Haring, Alice Walker and many other favored social heroes. Funny, I have an original Keith Haring " +
        "that belonged to her. I actually had no idea what it was until a close friend came over, for the first time, and " +
        "shouted “Nigga is this an original Keith Haring!?” I just loved the image, the “Free South Africa,'' message on the " +
        "bottom of it and that it belonged to my Aunt. Her crowning achievement was working at the Dallas Morning " +
        "News “invoking the spirit and power of the Black experience,” which won her a Pulitzer Prize. At this point, and " +
        "even before, Auntie had her pick of where she was going with her writing. I am certain that people repeatedly " +
        "ask “what do you/what do you want to write?” I do not have a good answer for that just yet because I really want " +
        "to write about it. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As I mentioned before, my aunt shared tables with many prominent voices but she was not just a vessel to " +
        "translate the gospels of civil rights warriors. She also involved herself and lived alongside the experiences she " +
        "was writing about. May 5th, 1990 she published an essay titled My Life as a Slave in which she wrote, “Few things " +
        "make me as mad as the N-word. I never say it, and I challenge other African Americans who do.” while " +
        "experiencing a day in the life of a slave workshop that she asked to join. Something thought-provoking for me, " +
        "because I do use the N-word. An article entitled 500 Americans in Paris toured an artist conference that took " +
        "place in France over a week. The main focus of this article is to highlight the successes of Blacks in Paris, " +
        "speaking of discussions she had with artists and their enthusiasm for Black art, specifically African American. " +
        "Separate from this, I have always wanted to visit and live in France. This article and another made it certain, for " +
        "me, that Paris is where I want to eventually end up. For her admissions letter to Columbia she elegantly " +
        "described the culture shock she experienced at Gilmore. Saying, “I learned something there about the different " +
        "cultures and religions which taught me acceptance rather than tolerance.” Another line that speaks to me and " +
        "my exposure to many different cultures. I could only hope to someday reach her level of acceptance. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "“If you like truth, people, writing, you most certainly need to pursue training in journalism” Which are words " +
        "of hers that I read for the first time four days ago, well after I made the decision to take my writing career more " +
        "seriously. A long time friend of my Aunt Toni sent me books every year and I took advantage of that for so long. " +
        "So long that I never really read the inscriptions she would write. My books are all in storage as I write this, along " +
        "with all the articles that I have that my Aunt wrote. But, I did not store my aunt's book. I never do and I have been " +
        "carrying around my personal copy of it for decades.I recently read the inscription while searching for some kind " +
        "of  message in my Aunt's writing, as I always do. Written by Nancy, the most impactful line, to me is “This book is " +
        "for you, if anyone.” A literal message, that I finally saw. My Aunt saw something in me that she relayed to her " +
        "closest friends and confidants, and I feel that she did leave me clues. Clues and people to connect with in order " +
        "to give me some direction for when I was ready to step into my gift. A gift, that I have been told by so many over " +
        "the years, that I need to find and step into. I am now ready to step into my gift and to see the truth in the world " +
        "and in myself. Toni died when I was about eight years old, and oddly enough, I feel like she knew me better than " +
        "anyone else in my life ever really could. She saw a path for me that no one in my family, except Grandma, could " +
        "even entertain as a possibility. For that, all the clues, and all the resources I have no excuse not to follow, she is " +
        "my guiding light. I, at very least, owe her an honest try at what she saw me accomplishing in my future, and now " +
        "I am trying as hard as I can. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In finding myself through Aunt Toni’s work, I have found so much more acceptance in the person that I am. " +
        "I have seen that the societal thoughts, comparisons, triumphs and failures that I have committed to truths were " +
        "and are, in fact, a piece of her within me. Even before I knew my aunt's thoughts, a fire was lit inside of me from " +
        "the pilot light of her soul. I have remained honest and humble though myself and the tribulations of my life. I do " +

        "Did you know that having HIV/AIDS can pose legal threats in 37states? During the beginning of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, " +
        "in the 1980s, legislation was passed in an attempt to “curb the spread” of the disease. As we deal with the current " +

        "Even though the HIV/AIDs pandemic affected all demographics regardless of age, race, and gender, it was designated the ailment " +
        "of homosexuals. This stigma made it easy for the government to prosecute people infected with HIV/AIDS. Criminal statutes–from " +
        "reckless endangerment to attempted murder–can still punish those who simply have potential to expose others to HIV. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The first recorded case of HIV/AIDs in the United States was in 1981. From 1981 to 1983 there were 3,391 recorded cases " +
        "of the illness. With a death rate of nearly 65 percent, HIV/AIDS quickly became some of the most deadly diseases in history. " +
        "From 1981 to 2019 in the U.S. there were 2.2 million HIV infections among people aged 13 and older–and, to date, around " +
        "700,000 deaths." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Let’s put that into perspective by comparing HIV/AIDS to COVID-19. In the relatively short TWO years since COVID-19 began, " +

        "\n" +

        "COVID-19 has caused more U.S. citizen deaths in the past two years than the all-time, 38-year, number of deaths " +

        "\n" +
        "But instead of trying to mandate our way out of this, many still act as if it should be a personal choice whether to " +

        "with most of the people often around my house while I lived there. Same with a part of myself as well. My place was a " +
        "revolving door of mechanics, people I met around and so on. I was raised in open door policy homes and that’s just how my own " +

        "hand, seemed completely unbothered. Unbothered to the point that I thought he might be deaf. Everyone loved the mustache and passed " +
        "him around to take a look. Imagine a bunch of big and burly dudes passing around a kitten, smiling at his face - then of course " +
        "you’ll smile too. " +

        "\n" +
        "Jack was a smash hit. He instantly became a favorite because of his chill demeanor, and his tendency to hold a chat if " +
        "you so pleased. I also could not bring myself to keep him inside so he developed pretty good hunting and social skills. We " +
        "would hang out in the driveway, working on cars and watching Jack hunt in the open field by our house. After showing off his " +
        "fetching skills we had been developing and the fact that he brought us a few treats, including a rabbit, everyone was sold. " +
        "People would always say. “This is the only cat I like!” And for the longest time, I felt the same. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "His fame continued to Columbus. There, he developed a habit of walking into people's houses. He also continued to get around " +
        "a lot so he ended up making a lot of friends on his own.  " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We would sit outside on the porch often, and when Jack was around, " +

        "a while. He is super cool!” " +

        "\n" +
        "One afternoon at a bar, a friend and I were talking about Jack when a girl walked up and asked, “Are you talking about the cat with a mustache!?” " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We were blown away. Turns out this girl was friends with my friend's little brother, and had seen pictures of Jack. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Through the rough times that Jack and I shared together, hard things needed to be done. Sometimes Jack needed to stay with " +
        "friends, while I got my shit together. But Jack's ability to get along with anyone or anything made him a complete treasure to " +
        "everyone around. I watched with admiration as Jack formed personal relationships with people. It was like he was everyone’s cat " +
        "and just about everyone has a personal story with him. From people saying that he comforted them in sadness to people saying " +
        "that he gave them good dreams to people even saying that he helped them through night terrors. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There were also all the times that Jack had to eat what I was eating. He was a big cat with an iron stomach which came in handy " +
        "when we were out of cat food. He ate anything that was meat and for some reason he loved sugar cookies as well. Many times we " +
        "had to share five dollar footlongs and whatever else we had around. Chicken scraps and all. I’m ashamed to admit that I let him " +
        "eat bone for years. I was a kid. I did not know that was bad at the time. He lived a full life ok! Don’t judge younger me! " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "It is a fabled and established thought that animals take on the personalities of their partners and vice versa. I always kind " +
        "of considered Jack to be my familiar. An extension of myself that could summon my compassions without complicating them with words. " +
        "People commented that we were very similar, which I always thought was hilarious. " +
        "\n" +

        "“Sure!” I’d say. “I can see that.” " +
        "\n" +

        "My tendency to keep people around, especially people who have nowhere else to go, has been a constant. I just want everyone, especially " +
        "my loved ones (of which there are several) to be safe and have something to eat. I want them to have a place to lay their head and " +
        "a place for them to be loved. Maybe that energy seeped into Jack, and he understood what my mission was. He made me feel as if I did " +
        "something right. For as young and irresponsible as I was when I got Jack, I wondered how I raised such a magnificent animal. An obviously " +
        "caring and compassionate one. Caring and compassionate enough to deal with dogs and my roommates pet rats who used to crawl all over Jack. " +
        "It wasn’t his favorite thing, but he let it happen and it was pretty shocking. He was a very surprising type of guy. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There are things we do to please our egos that inherently come with having a pet. For instance, everyone thinks that they have the best " +
        "pet. Everyone thinks their pet is the smartest, most loving and the most emotionally intuitive. I, of course, think all of these things " +
        "of Jack, but the affirmation from others made him objectively one of the most special. We, together, were able to create homes out of " +
        "dirty rentals. Homes that had good caring people around even if most of them were troubled. Jack did have his personal sense of acceptance " +
        "for others. Rather they be human or other animals, he did have preferences that, like my own, weren't very narrow. We both mostly accepted " +
        "others, but kept a weather eye on those who would potentially take advantage." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jack gave me a sense of accomplishment, a home and a sense of security. I could squeeze and kiss him all I wanted, but also knew he could " +
        "hold his own in the street (I’ve seen his mess up a dog pretty bad). Jack and I lived in about eight to ten different houses over four or " +
        "five different cities together before he finally passed away here in Cleveland, where he was born. He lived to be 13 years old and liked " +
        "taking car rides, cuddling up, and eating junk food right up until the end. Jack's very last new friend that I know of was a 75-year-old " +
        "Puerto Rican woman named Sonya who would eventually be my kitten Bobbi’s first new friend. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "At first, I wasn’t ready for a new cat. Jack was the very first pet that was just mine and to be honest I never really cared for cats too " +
        "much. Chances were that I wasn’t going to get another cat like Jack and there is no way I really could. When I got Bobbi, things were really " +
        "hard. It was almost like we weren’t compatible, and like it just wasn’t going to work out. I was still too attached to Jack and I think " +
        "that she saw that. Perhaps I wasn’t letting her in. Perhaps she saw the part inside of me that was not ready for a new fur friend. I cried " +
        "about this, but after some time we did bond. She is my new familiar and she has shown me a part of her that is similar to Jack, and yet " +
        "still completely her. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There was a part of me that believed that Jack belonged to an alien race. Like, they were going to take me and a select few other earth " +
        "dwellers back to a super advanced civilization of cats in a galaxy far, far away! Kind of like that episode of Futurama where it turns out " +
        "that Nibler is a part of an advanced race of aliens in charge of saving the universe. Nope, he died suddenly and, in the house, which " +
        "pleasantly surprised me. I always figured he’d just not come back one day, or that I would get a call from a stranger. " +
        "He had tags with my number on them and people actually would call me and say, “Hey! Is this Jack ? I found your cat.He’s friendly!” " +
        "Why would I put my name on the cat's collar? Anyway, I thought at least I didn’t have to watch him suffer. But, I also didn’t really get to see " +
        "what type of old old cat he would be. I also thought he would have perished long ago but he made it to 13! " +
        "Even after he turned 10 I remember thinking “If he hasn’t died yet he will probably live forever.” " +
        "I knew that wasn’t possible, but he had no signs of slowing down.After all, he had just been to the vet and they gave him a clean bill of " +
        "health.Alas everything must go, which is something I accepted long before Jack's death. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I’ve always thought it was a little weird to consider your pets your children. Cringe would be a better word. You get to choose " +
        "your pet and your pet chooses you. They come and go and you have special ones out of the bunch that stay with you forever. " +
        "You typically outlive them and any parent that has lost a child, will tell you that losing a child is nothing like losing " +
        "a pet. Anthropomorphizing, to me, is inappropriate and problematic for many reasons. It takes away the animal’s agency to " +
        "be an animal and to live out its own instinctual wants and needs. It also feels that this anthropomorphizing removes something " +
        "special from the relationship. The fact that you are coexisting with an animal, let alone an animal that could care for itself " +
        "(like a cat), is pretty incredible. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I respect nature and respect that anytime I let Jack or Bobbi outside they can choose to come back or not. I respect even more that they " +
        "did choose to do so, whatever the reason. Well, the reason is free food, but most of us know the bond they share with us as well." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I’m a big advocate for animal agency. I believe that if you are taking on the responsibility of housing an animal it is your responsibility " +
        "to appease the instinctual urges of the specific animal. If you have a herding breed of dog, you need to take it out running daily and so on. " +
        "One of the things that made Jack the best cat ever was the space I gave him. Jack completely chose his own destiny everyday. I " +
        "pretty much never imposed boundaries on him so he came and went as he pleased. Jack was my best friend, not my child. He decided " +
        "to never leave my life, no matter where we lived. He always found his way back to me after days sometimes and that was his call. " +
        "Jack is the most important part of my ability to look back. I remember people through him and times spent around him. I love you jack, " +
        "always and forever. And, thank you for choosing me. ",

    blkarttoday:
        "I have recently, in the past few years, witnessed a slight shift in conversations with Black artists. The sentiment " +
        "from some is that they would like to make art that does not have to speak to blackness or to The Struggle. I " +
        "slightly understand this thought process, but I do not think that it’s that easy. After all, there isn’t an on/off " +
        "switch for your emotional intellectual self. Now, you can choose to have a conversation about computers, for " +
        "instance, which does not have to speak to your personal experiences. The same applies to most things that you " +
        "would want to speak to with your art. You can literally make it about anything you want." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There are several caveats though. First, if you are tired of hearing the narrative, or you think that the art market is " +
        "saturated with stories of experiences in the Black body, then I would urge you to think about the history of being able to " +
        "openly express The Struggle. The tiny blip of time that Black people have been able to speak out about The Struggle has been " +
        "mostly violent and tragic. And when I say tiny blip, consider the following: Ruby Bridges was six years old in 1960 when she " +
        "attended the first desegregated school and right now she is 68 years old. The first African slaves landed on this dump of a " +
        "rock in 1619. That is 341 years of violent and disgusting oppression. Even after that period of time, the prevalent Black voices " +
        "that weren’t murdered were mostly kept in academia or in music studios. Popular American activists for civil rights have continued " +
        "to be assassinated into the mid 90s and it's still happening today here and around the world. It has only been the past five " +
        "to ten years that Black people have been able to express our art loudly, truthfully, on our own terms and even earn money " +
        "from it casually. The Black artist who gets to type, paint, photograph, draw, sculpt and broadcast “KILL WHITEY” can do so on " +
        "a pedistole and get paid for it these days. Our parents couldn’t do that and their parents obviously could not even dream of " +
        "that freedom. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Which brings me to my second point. 90 percent of the older Black generation (our parents and grandparents) would probably " +
        "tell us to preach our truths. Again, they did not have as much freedom to do so, and again, that was very recently. If " +
        "you were to talk to a Black icon from the civil rights era, through the 1980s, what do you think they would say about " +
        "this? I’m sure that they would reassure us that burn out was a thing before it was a buzzword. They would tell us that " +
        "the fight for our rights and our truth to be told can be utterly exhausting. But, they would also tell us that speaking " +
        "our truth is absolutely necessary at all costs in order to achieve progress. Everyday is a struggle. We as a population " +
        "know that, and it is so tiring. It can seem like everything is about race, and there is an argument to be made about " +
        "how potentially futile this decades long conversation is to keep having. It can feel like “Dam. We have told yall literally " +
        "everything about the details of The Struggle and you have done literally nothing with it.” We talk and talk and can’t " +
        "steer conversation away from ourselves most of the time. Yelling into what feels like a void about the abuse and " +
        "destruction of our bodies is heartbreaking for us and does break you down at times. Sometimes you wonder if anyone " +
        "can see past your blackness. But can we escape it? Is it something we need to escape? " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Caveat three. We are stuck. Barring surgeries or skin treatments to make yourself white or even just not black, " +
        "you are in a Black body. Regardless of how you feel about it, it is what you can not hide. I am a Black writer, " +
        "scientist, musician, queer, auto enthusiast, father and so on, but only one of those is obvious when I walk into a room. " +
        "Whereas most people are mysteries and things you should wonder about and ask questions to, Black peoples' histories are " +
        "often presumed. By this I mean, that when a white or non Black person sees a Black person, specifically in the city, " +
        "they consciously or subconsciously assume a portion of your story. You know, the parts where none of us have dads or " +
        "that we all have cousins in prison, or that we probably went through sooooooo much to get to where we are today. Rather " +
        "those things are true to your life or not, they are presumed and presumptions can really fuck up you ambitions as an " +
        "artist. Your blackness is inherent no matter what. The things that you went through in your life were as a Black person " +
        "and that changes almost every interaction you have had. So really no matter what you are speaking to or about with your " +
        "art, you are sharing it from the Black experience. You could not separate yourself from it if you wanted to, but you " +
        "don’t want to anyway because we are proud to be black, right? " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So many moments in our lives have been against us. That's not grandstanding or preaching, it is a fact. Housing, healthcare, " +
        "childcare, finance, education and all of these other systems have been proven to be inherently against the Black population. " +
        "So, rather you had a life where blackness was at the forefront or you had a life where being called “one of the good ones” " +
        "didn't bother you, you were resisted because of your color. The skin that you wear proudly has made it harder for you to " +
        "succeed, and rather you focus on that or not, it did shape you and will continue to shape you and your interactions. I can " +
        "choose to have a conversation about computers, but I can’t forget about the racist Russian kid in my high school computer " +
        "class. I can’t forget that I have applied at over 200 computer programming jobs and had less than a handful of interviews. I " +
        "can’t forget that I know that the computer technology field is filled with white men (and women). And I can imagine that they " +
        "probably seemed like a”better fit” because of their profile photo and not their skills. That has shaped me. That has taken " +
        "a dream I had and made it less desirable and maybe I hate it now. I love computers, but I don’t love the community I would " +
        "have to be surrounded with. I did it once before. Automotive engineering is mostly white men and I don’t wish to be in " +
        "those environments anymore. Those experiences made me feel less than and not as intelligent as I should be considered to " +
        "be and they also made me feel lonely. " +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our art and expression will always be from a place of blackness and we are lucky to be able to shout about it now. Recently. " +
        "There are so many stories about our lives that are impacted by who we are or what we look like. You can choose to not tell " +
        "that part of the story, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, or that you can ignore it. We all know that not dealing " +

        "random gigs. It could seem as though none of these jobs came naturally to me, but it was quite the contrary. The thing " +
        "is, I actually liked these places, which made it way easier to get things done. I, maybe for the first time in my life, " +
        "loved what I did during that period. Besides the shitty pay and the grossness of some of these jobs, socially speaking-mentally " +

        "The joy I felt in most of these places came from the people I worked with. While I was working within nonprofits, I " +
        "also loved the people I served, specifically the seniors. The same goes for the patrons at several of these places. " +
        "Working manual labor offers a community of people whose social behaviors and political ideologies aren't as complicated " +
        "as those in the more liberal organizations. More often than not, work sites are not places that you want to talk about " +
        "how you feel. You don't want to go on about any politics, especially not liberal politics. Not because it would make " +
        "someone uncomfortable, but because you would most likely make yourself a target. I am not a person who hides my ideologies " +
        "behind niceties. I think that (and being a big Black ''man'') is what kept me in the good graces of those I mostly ideologically " +
        "opposed. For one, there is a lot that we do see eye to eye on, and for two, those types of sonsabitches love a motherfucker " +
        "that won't back down. These types of men get off on other men that ''don't take no shit.'' had to learn to navigate that " +

        "the parts of me that are sweet, fun to talk to, caring, funny, queer, and complicated. It actually felt nice to be in a " +
        "professional echochamber. There isn’t exactly an exuberance of queerdo-radical POCs that work in the world of manual " +
        "labor. You can't possibly imagine how hard it is to share more than half of your waking hours with people who would " +
        "probably be fine with seeing you hurt if they knew who you really were. At the very least, someone that you get along " +
        "with and have maybe been learning a skill from for years would look at you completely differently if they knew any " +

        "jobs as opposed to being fired. And trust me, there have been not many, but a few of those sonsabitches that I did not " +

        "In fact, I think they would say that I did my jobs very well. And that is when I would put them on the spot and ask, " +
        " ''Then why exactly did you let me go?'' Fun fact, all of these job losses came from white women, so you know that looking " +
        "them in the eye and asking that question would cause them to fumble considerably. The common thread here is not to be " +

        "pressure but very easily overwhelmed, this does not equate to much more activities outside of work. Waking up early " +
        "literally makes my stomach hurt and thus Saturday becomes all I really look forward to. By then, everything has piled " +

        "When I was a teenage mechanic, I made up a list of my favorite days of the week, from worst to best. To me, Tuesday was " +
        "the worst day of the week. I would say that it sucked because it didn't really feel like time had passed. Next was Monday " +
        "because, well, Mondays. Third was Wednesday because ''Yeah, we're gettin there!'' Fourth was Thursday because it is ''pretty " +
        "much the weekend, right?'' Or at least I was going to drink like it was.Sunday followed by Friday.And Saturday is obviously " +
        "the best because there is no work in sight all day. Sunday falls a bit short because even though there is no work, the " +

        "I feel that it's time I quit looking for jobs that I don't belong in. I mean, I do think you should always chase your " +
        "dreams in some way at least. And if that means quitting your old life, then do it if you can. Hell, move away if you can " +
        "or take whatever leap you can. If the opportunity is given to you, you had better take it, if you ask me. Though, I " +
        "personally can't continue like this, and sustainable opportunities haven’t been coming my way. I am currently homeless " +
        "and chronically homeless, jobless and chronically jobless, and practically speaking, I just can't struggle in this way " +
        "anymore. My son is in his last year of high school, and I have no idea where he is going next. He is brilliant, so it " +
        "could be literally anywhere, including the military, unfortunately. It's not that I hate the military option, even though " +
        "I don't like it, but if it is the option, it will make it way harder for me to see him once he leaves. It's ironic, but " +
        "to see him as much as I can, I will need as much money as I can, and that means I will have to work as much as I can. " +
        "This sucks because I am not into the typical amount of time America gives dads with their children. I want more than that. " +
        "Unfortunately, I will have less time to spend with him on a regular work schedule, but at least I'll be able to take " +

        "Today was my first labor-only job search in years. In times of money crunching, I looked for wrenching work but not as " +
        "a means to an end. I would apply to one or two and then apply like crazy for programming, writing, bar, non-profit, or " +
        "whatever jobs. Whatever I could to help me stepforward towards what I wanted out of life. Now I'm taking a step back. " +
        "Maybe not forever, but to be honest, I feel so under supported by my community, why not forever? You know, the community " +
        "that told me that I wouldn't have to go back to that life if I didn't want to. The community that told me that I have " +
        "good ideas and that my ideas would take me somewhere. The community that told me that my words, my ''art,'' was worth " +
        "something. Maybe it is but not to them, not here, not in America.To me, the picket line between labor and liberal " +
        "organizations has a brick wall on it, and neither side wants you to cross it." +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So, this is my resignation from the liberal working world. I'm dusting off my wrenches and hoping my hands are still " +
        "as hard as they were back then. Mentally preparing myself with the good ol' ''You do what you gotta do'' mantra. The one " +
        "everyone uses instead of saying that their dreams were crushed. Ultimately, it doesn't matter how hard or easy a job is. " +
        "If it's not where you want to be or where you see your best self going, then what is it worth? Is it even worth the " +
        "paycheck? To most, it is, and I do wish I could be so easily motivated by money, but I am not. Money does not move me " +
        "to do just anything in order to receive it. Nevertheless , I must bow to fate and do what I gotta do.",
